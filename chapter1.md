### ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-04-05 at 6.39.16 AM.png)Before you start building anything on the web, think about what it should look like and who it's for.

**Write down the answers to the following questions:**

1. What kind of image would you like to have on your website? A picture of Saturn? The Grand Canyon?
2. Think of a list of things you like that you can add to your list items.
3. What colors would you like to use for your font and background?
4. Who is going to be looking at my website? In other words, who is my audience?
5. What message am I trying to get across with this website? How can I make the most important parts stand out?
6. What kinds of colors and shapes do I want to use?
7. Does my website have a theme?
