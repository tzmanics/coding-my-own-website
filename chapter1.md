### ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-04-05 at 6.39.16 AM.png)Before you start building anything on the web, think about what it should look like and who it's for.

**Write down the answers to the following questions:**

* ## What kind of image would you like to have on your website? A picture of Saturn? The Grand Canyon?
* ## Think of a list of things you like that you can add to your list items.
* ## What colors would you like to use for your font and background?
* ## What kinds of colors and shapes do I want to use?
* ## Does my website have a theme?
