This means the computer translated what you typed and made the page you can now see in your web browser. You can also right-click the index.html file and choose ‘Open With...’ then choose a **web browser** like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome or Safari to see what the rendering looks like OR a **text editor** like Notepad to look at your code.

There's not much here yet!
